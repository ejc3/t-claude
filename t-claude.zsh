# t-claude [SESSION] [--resume <id>]
#
# PREREQUISITES (all provided by the dev-box setup in ejc3/aws dev-user-data.tf; listed
# here so this script is self-documenting if copied elsewhere):
#   - zsh                  this is a zsh function, sourced from ~/.zshrc.
#   - tmux                 3.4+ works; the dev boxes run 3.7b. tmux is attached in NORMAL
#                          client/server mode (NOT `tmux -CC` control mode -- no iOS
#                          client speaks it). Sessions/windows are managed here.
#   - claude               Claude Code on PATH.
#   - nosync-wrap          /usr/local/bin/nosync-wrap -- a pty shim that strips Claude's
#                          synchronized-output sequences (CSI ?2026h/l) so tmux does not
#                          swallow scrollback. OPTIONAL: if absent, launches bare claude
#                          (scrollback breaks, everything else works).
#   - ~/.tmux.conf         for native (swipe/wheel) scrollback, needs all three:
#                            set -ga terminal-overrides ',*:smcup@:rmcup@'   (primary screen)
#                            set -g status off                               (full-screen pane)
#                            set -ga terminal-overrides ',*:indn@'           (linefeed scroll)
#                          and a SINGLE full-screen pane (splits re-break scrollback).
#   - HIST_IGNORE_SPACE    set in ~/.zshrc -- lets the space-prefixed launch command stay
#                          out of shell history (see the `cmd=" $inner"` note below).
#
#   SESSION : tmux session = a named group of related projects ("Apps","Backend",
#             "AWS"). Omit it and the session defaults to "<folder>-<hash>" (unique
#             per directory).
#   WINDOW  : one per project folder, keyed by folder path (hidden @tclaude_key), so
#             two same-named folders never collide.
#   --resume <id> : a NEW window "<folder>-<id>" (claude session id as discriminator).
#   PANES   : never touched — split your own terminal in with Ctrl-b % / ".
# If you pass a SESSION but this folder's claude is already open in a DIFFERENT
# session, t-claude MOVES it here live (move-window keeps claude running) — no prompt,
# since the move is non-destructive.
# Safety: only windows WE create carry @tclaude_key, so manual windows are never
# found, reused, renamed, moved, or closed.

  # nosync-wrap strips Claude's synchronized-output-mode sequences (CSI ?2026h/l)

  # group is ORPHANED and POSIX silently discards stop signals. As a shell job it lives
  # in the shell's session, so Ctrl-Z suspends it and `fg` resumes it -- verified.
  # Leading space keeps this out of shell history: ~/.zshrc sets HIST_IGNORE_SPACE, so
  # zsh skips space-prefixed commands. Without it every launch types the full
